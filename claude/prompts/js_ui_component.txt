### PROMPT: Improve UI and Backend Integration

You are working on a project with two parts:
1. **General HTML page (old version)**: This page has the basic structure with embedded JS code. However, it is not integrated with the backend.
2. **Settings JS code**: The new JS code is designed to handle communication with the backend.

**General HTML & JS Code:**
\`\`\`html
{{GENERAL_HTML}}
\`\`\`

**New JS Backend Code:**
\`\`\`js
{{SETTINGS_JS}}
\`\`\`

Your task:
1. Integrate the new JS code with the old HTML page (general.html).
2. Ensure the new JS code communicates correctly with the backend.
3. Suggest any improvements or refactorings to the old page's structure if needed.

Provide the updated HTML/JS code that combines both the backend logic and the old page structure.
